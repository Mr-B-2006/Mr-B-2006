## Welcome to my profile ^-^ ✌

If you hate looking at the left side of your screen, my name is Benjamin Steward, I am 18 years old and currently on my gap year, I am looking to enter a degree apprenticeship in software engineering. 

I'm currently working own my own game engine (Arrow Engine) and it's map editor tool (Bow), in C++ SFML

I mainly enjoy making PC games in C++ with SFML, I have huge list of projects brewing in the back of my mind so you might want to keep an eye out on my profile ;)
(I do also intend to branch out and create some more general purpose software and games not only for PC but for mobile and other platforms)
