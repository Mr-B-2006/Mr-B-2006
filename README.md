## Welcome to my profile ^-^ âœŒ

If you hate looking at the left side of your screen, my name is Benjamin Steward, I am 18 years old and currently on my gap year :D, I am looking to enter a degree apprenticeship in software engineering. 

Im currently working on "BogoSearch", a joke search algorithm based off of everyone's favourite sorting algorithm "BogoSort", with a visualiser and GUI to allow users to set parameters such as the amount of indices 

I mainly enjoy making PC games in C++ with SFML, I have huge list of projects brewing in the back of my mind so you might want to keep an eye out on my profile ;)
(I do also intend to branch out and create some more general purpose software and games not only for PC but for mobile and other platforms)

Computer Specs: ðŸ’ª
~CPU: i5-14400F
~RAM: 32GB 
~GPU: RTX 4070 TI Super
~Storage: 5.8TB of storage across multiple SSDs and HDDs
